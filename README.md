# Simmer_Cookbook

## Description

Simmer Cookbook is an application that assists those who are interested in cooking or are current cooks. This application enables the user to create thier own virtual cookbook, one that will be customized to include their favourite recipes. The user can search for recipes or add their own recipes to the cookbook. They can also update these recipes or delete them if they are no longer needed. This application solves the problem of having to resort to different resources to find your favourite recipes, as your cookbook will have your favourite recipes in one spot.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to assist the user in storing and organizing their favourite recipes, or new recipes they are planning on making.

## How it Works

The user can initially sign up for the application, and can login afterwards. Once the user is signed in, they can search for recipes (via the recipe API) and add them to their cookbook.
